      Hello!! My name is Isabella Gonzales, I'm 16 years old, and I love robotics. I love music (singing and playing the guitar), making origami, and painting. A fun fact about me is that I sang in the National Theather wearing pijamas when I was 6.<br><br>

### Why *Ruwance*?
The name *Ruwance* comes from combining the Quechua word "**ruway**" and the English word "**chance**". Ruway means "to create" or "to do", which really reflects who we are, a team that is always making, building, and experimenting. As students of Robotek from Lima, Peru, we have learned that creativity and resilience are important traits to succeed in and enjoy our robotics journey.
