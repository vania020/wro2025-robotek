# Vehicle Base

![Vehicle Base](./vehicle_base.png)

This piece is the **main platform of our vehicle**. It supports all the main componentslike the the Raspberry Pi, LiDAR, and camera housings. It was **laser-cut from MDF**, which gives it a good balance between strength and lightness. The design includes **placed holes** for screwing in the electronic and mechanical parts.

**Fabrication Process**
We started by sketching and prototyping the base on cardboard and acrylic to test the dimensions. After confirming the fit, we finalized the design in Fusion 360 and cut it in MDF for the final version. This iterative process helped us improve **stability, space efficiency, and assembly alignment**.
