![LiDAR Housing](./lidar_housing.png)

This part works as the mount for the LiDAR sensor. Itâ€™s built with a slight incline to give the sensor a better scanning angle and improve how it measures distances from walls. The design includes four screw holes that let it attach firmly to both the vehicle base and the LiDAR itself, keeping everything stable while the robot is moving.
